# Kyle J. Heaven

 Hello everyone, and welcome to my portfolio

 Top 3 things to know about me:
 
 1. Games
 2. Music
 3. Very Social/Approachable

 I'll be real when I saw when it comes to school i'm very smart, also since I work at the STEAM center. But when it comes to anything else, I may or may not be lacking in **common sense**, ESPECIALLY at home, but that's besides the point. What i'm trying to say is that many things in lyfe can wayfer, including humans, but we all make mistakes so it okay. That's what GitHub's sorta made for right? **Troubleshooting**. I can't wait to see what I can make, and see what everyone else can make too!
